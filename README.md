NTT is short for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and through its various brands it provides a range of
telecommunications and IT services on a global basis.

Within the NTT Group is NTT Limited - where I happen to work - I won't explain what they do, you can read all about them
here: https://hello.global.ntt

The logo is the focus here, not only is it nice, you can see it here:

But did you know that logo can be drawn using a mathematical function?

It is known as a limaçon or sometimes a limaçon of Pascal.  Not sure what that is? you can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima%C3%A7on

The code in this repository uses p5 js to render a limaçon in the NTT style and experiment with it.

You can find a live version of it here: https://ntt.am.cx

If you want to dive in and play with the code, you can find it as a p5js sketch here: https://editor.p5js.org/alexmoore/sketches/HJsYLRMUI
